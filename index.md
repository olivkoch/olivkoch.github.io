**Computer vision and deep learning in the real world**

I lead the ML team at [Onfido](http://www.onfido.com). We use computer vision and deep learning for online identity verification. From 2015 to 2021, I led the machine learning team for recommendation at Criteo. From 2010 to 2014, I led the computer vision team at Thales Optronics in France.

I graduated with a PhD at MIT in 2010 under the supervision of [Prof. Seth Teller](https://people.csail.mit.edu/teller/). I was a core member of the [MIT team](http://grandchallenge.mit.edu) at the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007. My work was published at CVPR, ICCV, ICRA and IJFR. I teach the deep learning class at ENSAE Paris.
