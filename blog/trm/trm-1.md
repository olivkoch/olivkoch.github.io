In late 2025, a new method made a big splash in the ML community: TRM, for Tiny Recursive Models.

The model outperformed SOTA models on ARC-AGI 2 with a much smaller parameter count.

This is a series of posts about this architecture. We investigate whether TRMs can learn to reason better than Transfomers can.

This first post is an introduction to TRM. If you know this already, you can skip to post 2 (playing Connect 4 with TRMs).
